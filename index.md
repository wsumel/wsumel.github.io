## About Me

<!-- I am a Ph.D. student at ... -->
I am currently a Ph.D. student at Northwestern Polytechnical University, focusing on visual object tracking. My research interests include RGB object tracking, lightweight tracking algorithms, and multimodal tracking such as RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E. I am passionate about developing efficient and robust tracking methods for real-world applications.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Object Tracking, Efficient Model, Multimodal Model
