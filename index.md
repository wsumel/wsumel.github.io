## About Me 👨‍🎓

<!-- I am a Ph.D. student at ... -->
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Control Science and Engineering at the School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, under the supervision of Professor Gong Cheng. My research interests include visual object tracking, multimodal information fusion, and efficient model. My related works have been published in top-tier venues such as AAAI, ACM MM, IEEE TIP, IEEE TCSVT, Pattern Recognition, and ICME.
