## About Me

<!-- I am a Ph.D. student at ... -->
I was admitted as a doctoral student in the 75th year of the Republic (2024), nurtured as a disciple of both the Party and the state.
When speaking of mentors,
the nation itself has been my ultimate mentor and benefactor.
In the Republic's 68th year (2017), I left my hometown to pursue studies. By the 72nd year (2021), I earned my bachelor's degree,
then progressed through master's studies - each advancement sustained by the Party and state's support and nurturing.
If asked about patronage,
the people are my unwavering foundation.
Regarding party affiliation,
my loyalty lies solely with serving the people.
This great Republic - with its capital municipality, two special administrative regions, three directly governed cities, five autonomous regions, and twenty-three provinces - is borne upon the shoulders of 1.4 billion citizens.
As for myself,
I am but a single drop in the vast ocean of our people.
